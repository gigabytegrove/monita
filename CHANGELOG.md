# Changelog

## 1.3.7 — 2026-10-03

### Complete Monita source identity cleanup

- Migrated the internal Go module/import path from the upstream server path to `github.com/gigabytegrove/monita`.
- Renamed former MU-only source files, types, realtime internals, and capability identity to canonical Monita names.
- Added canonical `/monitainfo` and `/api/monita/v1/*` endpoints while retaining legacy aliases for existing clients.
- Added canonical `X-Monita-Key`, `X-Monita-MFA-Code`, and Monita webhook signature headers with legacy Gotify header fallbacks.
- Moved new session cookies, backup names, message extras, Docker/build paths, test harnesses, and current UI copy to Monita naming.
- Preserved only deliberate compatibility/legal/history references to Gotify.

### Compatibility

- Existing Gotify-style headers, compatibility routes, legacy environment variables, legacy config/database/secret paths, and legacy backup bundles remain accepted.
- External `github.com/gotify/plugin-api` and `github.com/gotify/location` dependencies remain because they are upstream compatibility dependencies.
- Historical changelog/release notes and license attribution are intentionally not rewritten.

## 1.3.6 — 2026-10-03

### Monita naming and interface refresh

- Replaced remaining active Gotify MU product branding across runtime, configuration, and user-facing surfaces with Monita naming.
- Made `MONITA_*` the primary environment-variable namespace while retaining legacy `GOTIFY_*` and `GOTIFY_MU_*` fallbacks where required for upgrade compatibility.
- Renamed the server environment template to `monita-server.env.example` and updated fresh installs to prefer `data/monita.db` while automatically preserving existing `data/gotify.db` deployments.
- Updated secret-store, plugin trust, connector, audit-export, CLI, and SMTP/syslog identity strings to Monita equivalents.
- Introduced a new polished Monita Web UI visual system with refreshed surfaces, navigation, header, login, cards, controls, spacing, and typography.
- Hid the Appearance/theme selector from Settings while retaining stored/system theme compatibility.
- Preserved protocol-level compatibility identifiers such as `/gotifyinfo` and required upstream Go dependency/module references to avoid breaking existing clients.

### Compatibility

- Existing deployments using legacy Gotify environment-variable names continue to work through compatibility fallbacks.
- Existing `data/gotify.db` databases are detected automatically and continue to be used in place.
- No manual database migration is required.

## 1.3.5 — 2026-10-01

### Canonical application branding

- Replaced the hard-coded **Monita / Messaging & alerts** header treatment with the supplied canonical full Monita logo.
- Mobile header branding now uses the supplied canonical standalone Monita icon.
- Added versioned icon/logo URLs and advanced the PWA shell cache so browsers and installed PWAs discard stale branding assets immediately.
- Updated favicon, Apple touch icon, Microsoft tile icon, and PWA manifest icon references to the canonical standalone icon.
- No database, API, protocol, or configuration migration is required.

## 1.3.4 — 2026-10-01

### Transparent icon background

- Removed only the 512×512 gray canvas rectangle from the canonical Monita icon SVG so the icon background is transparent.
- Preserved all icon artwork, gradients, embedded image data, geometry, colors, clipping, and the original 512×512 vector canvas unchanged.
- Updated the active Web/PWA icon aliases to the same transparent canonical artwork.

### Compatibility

- No database, API, protocol, or configuration migration is required.
- Existing deployments can update in place.

## 1.3.3 — 2026-10-01

### Canonical branding refresh

- Replaced the active Monita Web, PWA, documentation, and release artwork with the exact vector masters supplied on 2026-10-01.
- The full logo and standalone icon are now preserved as canonical SVG source files and reused directly by their active aliases.
- Removed obsolete Gotify-MU PNG artwork from the active repository tree so stale branding cannot appear through an unused fallback.
- Branding documentation now explicitly forbids redraws, recolors, traces, substitutions, or silent regenerated variants.

### Compatibility

- No database migration is required.
- No API or client protocol changes are required.
- Existing deployments can update in place.

## 1.3.2 — 2026-10-01

### Web shell

- Fixed literal `\\n` escape sequences being rendered above the Monita header in the desktop Web UI and installed PWA.
- PWA metadata is now emitted as normal HTML lines instead of escaped text.
- Bumped the PWA shell cache so installed clients discard the defective cached 1.3.1 shell immediately.
- No database, protocol, or client migration is required.

## 1.3.1 — 2026-10-01

### Desktop realtime notifications

- Incoming realtime messages now create an in-app toast in the desktop Web UI and installed PWA even when browser/OS notification permission is unavailable.
- Toasts identify the originating Chat or Notification Channel, include the sender when available, and show a short message preview.
- Mention toasts explicitly state that the current user was mentioned and remain visible longer than ordinary message toasts.
- Every realtime toast includes an **Open** action that jumps directly to the originating Channel or Chat.
- Desktop toast stacking is capped so bursts of messages remain readable without covering the entire interface.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-10-01

### Desktop and PWA

- Reworked the desktop Web UI around a communication-first workspace instead of treating Chats and Notification Channels as the same message list.
- Chat Channels now use a full-height conversation view with left/right message bubbles, sender identity, day separators, mention emphasis, typing state, inline collaboration controls, search, and a persistent composer.
- Desktop navigation separates Chats from Notification Channels so conversation traffic and operational alerts are easier to scan.
- Added a real installable Monita PWA with a service worker, cached application shell, standalone manifest metadata, install control, and same-origin asset caching while leaving authenticated API responses uncached.

### Mentions

- New Chat messages now use canonical `monita::mentionUserIds` metadata for realtime clients.
- The Web/PWA client recognizes both canonical and legacy mention metadata for existing deployments.
- Browser/PWA notifications explicitly state when another user mentioned you and open the correct Channel.
- Mention alerts also trigger the Web notification sound even when the underlying Chat message priority is below the normal sound threshold.

### Branding cleanup

- Removed remaining user-facing Gotify MU labels from the active Web experience.
- API descriptions now use Monita terminology while documented Gotify compatibility remains intact where it is technically required.
- Internal compatibility identifiers are preserved only where changing them would break existing clients, upgrades, or persisted data.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-09-30

### Message controls

- Added per-message controls for assignment, resolve/reopen, and post-send attachments.
- Normal notifications no longer show Assign, Resolve, or Attach unless the sender explicitly enables those controls.
- The server enforces the same control metadata, so hidden controls cannot be invoked directly through the API.
- Enabled Attach permits recipients of that message to add a file/image; it is no longer restricted to message managers after the sender explicitly opts the message into attachment workflow.
- Capability discovery advertises `messageControls: true`.

### Retention

- Notification Channels now default to 24-hour message retention.
- Existing Notification Channels are migrated once to 24-hour retention.
- Chat Channels are migrated to indefinite retention by default.
- Retention uses exact 24-hour periods and applies equally to active and archived messages.
- Expired messages remove their attachment records; the existing orphan-attachment cleanup removes the corresponding stored files.

### Administration

- Administrators can permanently delete an individual message in any Channel, including its associated attachment records and stored attachment files.
- Archiving keeps the complete message and its attachments together.

### Chat mentions

- Added `@username` member autocomplete to the Monita Web Chat composer.
- `@username` tokens are visually highlighted in Web Chat messages.
- Channel owners and administrators can retrieve mention candidates even when they do not have a redundant direct membership row.
- Existing mention persistence and targeted mention delivery remain in place.

## 1.1.9 — 2026-09-30

### Notification Channel image delivery

- Notification Channels can now receive inline image attachments through the same authenticated multipart message path used by Chat Channels.
- Explicit notification titles are preserved for image-bearing Notification Channel messages.
- Notification image messages remain push-style messages rather than self-authored Chat messages, so the posting account still receives its own Home Assistant alerts on connected Monita clients.
- Channel owners and administrators can use the image route even when no redundant membership row exists.
- Capability discovery now advertises `notificationImages: true` for Monita-aware clients.

### Home Assistant compatibility

- Designed for Monita for Home Assistant 1.6.0 and newer.
- Older Home Assistant integrations continue to use their existing text and Chat-image paths unchanged.

## 1.1.8 — 2026-09-28

### Less intrusive administrator elevation

- Normal administrator pages now use the signed-in admin session instead of requiring repeated step-up elevation just to view routine administrative state.
- Viewing users, audit history, security policy, operations, sessions, service accounts, Groups, integrations, schedules, escalations, connectors, update status, and the Plugin Catalog no longer requires elevation.
- Routine non-destructive administration such as creating or editing Groups, integrations, schedules, escalations, connectors, and Channel membership/assignment settings no longer requires repeated password confirmation.
- Step-up elevation remains required for destructive or high-impact actions including user changes/deletion, Channel ownership/security changes, member/group removal, password/MFA/passkey changes, security-policy changes, backup/restore/diagnostics, session revocation, service-account credential changes, secret regeneration, software installation, and destructive deletions.
- The default administrator elevation window is now four hours instead of one hour when no explicit policy has been saved.
- The Web UI now uses the configured administration elevation duration instead of always requesting a hard-coded one-hour window.
- Local, LDAP, passkey, and OIDC elevation paths now honor the configured policy consistently, and password/OIDC requests are capped by that policy.

## 1.1.7 — 2026-09-27

### Chat image messages

- Chat Channels now support sending image attachments directly from the composer on desktop and mobile web.
- The Chat composer accepts JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP images, supports up to eight images per message, shows previews before sending, supports drag/drop and pasted images, and allows image-only messages.
- Image attachments are persisted before realtime delivery so recipients receive complete attachment metadata with the original message event.
- Images render inline in message history and open at full size when selected.
- Authenticated image attachment downloads are served inline while non-image attachments retain download behavior.
- Realtime message conversion now preserves extras and collaboration metadata, including attachment information.
- The MU capability document now advertises `chatImages: true` for companion clients.

## 1.1.6 — 2026-09-27

### Channel images on new and existing Channels

- Added Channel image selection directly to **Create Channel**, including local preview, change, and remove-before-create controls.
- New Channels can now be created with their image in the same workflow instead of requiring a second edit afterward.
- Existing Channels continue to expose **Upload image / Change image / Remove image** in **Edit Channel** and the Channel action menu.
- If an image upload fails after Channel creation, Monita preserves the new Channel and token and clearly directs the user to add the image from **Edit Channel**.

## 1.1.5 — 2026-09-27

### Fresh Web UI after updates

- Monita now serves the Web UI entry document with explicit no-cache headers so a completed in-app update cannot leave the browser on an older frontend bundle.
- This ensures UI changes such as the restored Channel image controls appear immediately after updating instead of requiring a hard refresh.
- Existing hashed static assets remain compatible with normal browser caching.

## 1.1.4 — 2026-09-27

### Software update status cleanup

- Completed update progress and activity are now transient instead of being shown again every time the Software Update page is reopened.
- The completion state remains visible while an update is actively being watched, then clears after the page reloads or the user navigates away and returns.
- Failed update states remain visible so errors are not silently hidden.

This changelog highlights user-visible changes in Monita. Older releases may use the previous **Gotify MU** name.

## 1.1.3 — 2026-09-27

### Channel image management

- Restored Channel image controls directly in **Edit Channel**.
- Added the current Channel image preview with **Upload image**, **Change image**, and **Remove image** actions.
- Kept Channel image shortcuts in the Channel action menu.
- Allowed Channel managers to use the same edit and image-management controls already permitted by the server.
- Kept token regeneration and destructive Channel actions restricted to owners and administrators.

## 1.1.2 — 2026-09-27

### Single-container software updates

- Software updates now run entirely inside the main Monita container.
- Removed the updater worker container and Docker socket requirement.
- Monita downloads the published runtime for the server architecture, verifies its checksum and version, installs it into persistent Monita data, and restarts itself in place.
- Updated runtimes survive normal container restarts because the active runtime is stored with Monita's persistent data.
- Fresh installations and manual upgrades can continue using prebuilt container images; no local compilation is required.

## 1.1.1 — 2026-09-27

### Faster installs and updates

- Normal Docker installations now download a prebuilt Monita image instead of compiling Monita on the server.
- Prepared the prebuilt release-image distribution used by later update improvements.
- Local source builds remain available for development and troubleshooting.
- Improved container publishing for common 64-bit Intel/AMD and ARM systems.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-09-27
