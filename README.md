Monita is a self-hosted notification and messaging platform for people, teams, home automation, and connected systems. It combines shared Channels, chat, automation, integrations, and multi-user administration in one platform.

> Monita retains selected legacy protocol routes and identifiers where required for existing clients and non-destructive upgrades.

## Current release

**Monita 1.3.7** is the current server release documented by this repository.

Companion projects:

- [Monita for Android](https://github.com/gigabytegrove/monita-android) — native Android client; current testing release: **0.3.18**
- [Monita for Home Assistant](https://github.com/gigabytegrove/monita-ha) — HACS-compatible Home Assistant integration; current release: **1.8.7**

Release-specific changes are tracked in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Installation and update instructions are in [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## What Monita does

Monita gives you one place to receive, organize, share, and automate notifications.

You can use it to:

- create private, shared, and Global Channels
- deliver notifications to multiple users
- use Chat Channels for two-way conversation
- connect Home Assistant, MQTT, Webhooks, email, RSS/Atom, Syslog, and calendars
- schedule notifications and escalation workflows
- use Quiet Hours, Digests, acknowledgements, mentions, replies, reactions, and assignments
- manage users, Groups, permissions, integrations, and security settings from the Web UI
- continue using supported legacy-compatible clients and integrations during migration

## Why Monita

Traditional push-notification servers are often designed around one user or one application owner. Monita adds shared access and collaboration so the same Channel can be useful to a household, team, support group, or automation environment.

Monita is designed around its own server, Web, Android, Home Assistant, automation, and collaboration experience while retaining selected compatibility contracts needed by existing installations.

## Getting started

### Docker Compose

Docker Compose is the recommended installation method. **Normal installs use a prebuilt Monita image; nothing is compiled on your server.**

```bash
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/gigabytegrove/monita.git
cd monita
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

At minimum, set a secure administrator password in `.env`:

```env
MONITA_DEFAULTUSER_NAME=admin
MONITA_DEFAULTUSER_PASS=CHANGE-THIS-PASSWORD
```

By default, the Web UI is available on:

```text
http://SERVER-IP:8080
```

Persistent application data is stored in the configured Monita data directory and remains in place when the container is updated. Normal installs use the prebuilt Monita image, so users do not need to compile the application locally.

## Prebuilt release image archives

If your environment cannot pull directly from GitHub Container Registry, Monita also publishes prebuilt Docker image archives with each supported release.

Download the archive that matches your server architecture, verify it with the published checksum file, load it with Docker, and start Monita with Docker Compose. This path does not compile Monita locally.

Supported release archives:

- `linux-amd64` for standard 64-bit Intel/AMD systems
- `linux-arm64` for 64-bit ARM systems

## Updating

Monita can check for published releases from **Settings → Software Update**. Starting with 1.1.2, updates are handled entirely inside the single Monita container: Monita downloads and verifies the published runtime, restarts itself in place, and keeps the same persistent data. No updater container or local compilation is used.

For a manual update:

```bash
cd /opt/monita
git pull --ff-only origin master
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Back up your persistent data before major upgrades.

See [Deployment](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for installation, update, backup, and troubleshooting guidance.

## Legacy compatibility

Monita preserves selected protocol routes, token formats, headers, configuration fallbacks, and migration behavior so existing installations and supported clients can move forward without destructive changes.

New installs and current documentation use Monita-native names and identifiers wherever compatibility does not require otherwise.
